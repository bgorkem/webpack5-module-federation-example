# Webpack 5 - Federated Modules - with Lerna

## Introduction

Webpack 5 allows live importing of a remote module from another URL, once you load the script and (import / export) modules

Here we use a dynamically loaded library in lib1 package

We use lerna and yarn workspaces to manage 2+ packages in one repo

Yarn workspaces manage cross package dependencies / symbolic links

Lerna manage package publishing / running scripts ...


## Run

`yarn` to install

`yarn start` to start sites

Then browse http://localhost:3001
